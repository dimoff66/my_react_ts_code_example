Here is an example of my #React-Redux-Typescript code. 
It was a part of real project, but this version is simplified due to signed NDA

But still it shows most of my abilities to create complex applications using technologies mentioned above

- Please take a look at Components/Reservation component and its subcomponents: TabGuests and TabTables
They show my ability to create type safe functional components with complex logic, and my ability to 
memoize values using react hooks

- Also take a look at Classes folder - at Classes/Basic class and its implementations. They show my ability
to create scalable models-based system, using complex generic functions and generic classes.

- For styles in this particular project i'm using css-modules, but i'm experienced in themed styled-components as well
